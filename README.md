# Car Price Prediction

This project builds machine learning models to predict car prices based on various technical and market features. The goal is to help understand which factors most strongly influence automobile pricing in the US market and develop an accurate predictive model.

## 📂 Project Contents
- `Car Price Assignment.csv` — Dataset used for training and evaluation  
- `Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb` — Google Colab notebook containing the full workflow

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify key variables affecting car prices  
- Build and compare multiple regression models  
- Evaluate model accuracy using R², MSE, and MAE  
- Perform feature importance analysis  
- Apply hyperparameter tuning to improve performance  

## 🧠 Models Implemented
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- Support Vector Regressor  

## 📊 Key Findings
- Gradient Boosting delivered the best prediction performance  
- Engine size, curb weight, horsepower, mileage, and brand are major price drivers  
- Model tuning further improved accuracy  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
